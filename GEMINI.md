# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory, `go-platform-kit`, appears to be a placeholder or an initialized but empty repository for a backend engineering template in Go. While the `README.md` describes a comprehensive Go project with various features, no Go source files (`.go`) or a `go.mod` file were found within this directory or its subdirectories during the analysis. It is likely intended to be the root of a Go project that has not yet been scaffolded or cloned.

## Key Files

*   **`README.md`**: Provides a high-level overview of the `go-platform-kit` project's purpose, features, use cases, and engineering principles. It describes what the project *should* contain when fully implemented.
*   **`.git/`**: This directory indicates that `go-platform-kit` is a Git repository, managing version control for the files within.

## Usage

Based on the `README.md`, this directory is intended to house a Go backend application. To proceed with development, you would typically:

1.  **Initialize a Go module**: Run `go mod init <module-name>` within this directory if starting a new project from scratch.
2.  **Add Go source code**: Create `.go` files for your application's logic.
3.  **Clone a Go project**: If this is meant to be a clone of an existing `go-platform-kit` implementation, you would clone the actual project into this location or a subdirectory.

Currently, without Go source files, there are no specific build, run, or test commands to document for this directory. These would be established once the Go project structure is in place.
